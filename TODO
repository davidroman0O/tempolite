[ ] - add that https://github.com/uber-go/goleak because we never know and we need quality runtime
[ ] - with pause-resume, do we pause-resume sub-workflows too? - we're not testing it... (apparently we do but we need more test and more documentation) we should by default, if parent is pause then children too, even newly created ones - status of the parent determine the behaviour of the children
[ ] - when macbook goes sleep, it stops the workflows - probably not related but investigate
[ ] - Add a `sort.Slice(execs, func(i, j int) bool ` on all list result in the database memory implementation - quality of life
[ ] - Check close - seems okay?
[ ] - Configure logs
[ ] - More tests
[ ] - Optional automatic db cleaning - since we track Runs, we need to have it Run-based
[ ] - `ent` sqlite or raw sqlite?
